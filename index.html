  <h1>Chocolate</h1>
  
  <p> Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE)</p>

  <h2>What is so good about it?</h2>
  <p>Due to the properties and nutritional composition, eating chocolate, in addition to delicious, can also be beneficial for health.</p> 

<p>However, it is convenient to know in advance that, much of the studies carried out in this regard, derive from the use of pure cocoa or dark chocolate (with a low percentage of added sugar)</p>

<h3>1. Protects cardiovascular health</h3>
  <p>As we have just seen, chocolate is a food that stands out for the presence of flavonoids. In particular, flavonols are found in greater amounts in dark chocolate and the experts concluded that they are responsible for its role as a cardiovascular protector.</p>

<p>Some studies, such as this one published in the journal Circulation, indicate that regular intake of plant foods (including cocoa) is associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.</p>

<p>The possible actions that make it possible are lowering blood pressure, improving insulin resistance, and supporting blood vessel function.</p>

  <h3>2. Helps reduce stress</h3>
  <p>As has already been seen, some plant compounds are known to have various positive repercussions on health. This occurs both physically and mentally.</p>

<p>In animal research, an effect of polyphenols on the regulation of hormones related to stress and anxiety is observed.</p>

<p>In reference to humans, these consequences have also been referred to. However, at the moment it cannot be established whether lowering cortisol levels improves the psychological well-being of people subjected to high levels of stress.</p>

  <h3>3. Slows cognitive decline and improves mood</h3>
  <p>Again it is the flavonols that are responsible for the possible benefits of eating dark chocolate for the brain.</p>

<p>As experts point out, these cocoa compounds may be interesting for preventing cognitive decline (especially in people at risk) and improving the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain.</p>

<p>Likewise, in this essay published in The Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry, the property of chocolate to improve mood and create a feeling of pleasure and well-being is recognized.</p>
